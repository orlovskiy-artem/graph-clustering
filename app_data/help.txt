Welcome to graph clustering program guide!

Algorithms:
1) MCL - Markov clustering, doesn't require any special parameters
2) KMedoid - KMedoid clustering, The k-medoids or partitioning around
             medoids (PAM) algorithm is a clustering algorithm 
             reminiscent of the k-means algorithm.
3) Spectral - Spectral clustering, method uses spectral embeddings from 
              eigenvectors of graph's laplacian. After computing embeddings,
              KMeans is used. 

Buttons:
1) Get node embeddings - plot a graph of spectral node embeddings
1) cluster MCL - use Markov clustering
2) cluster KMedoid - use KMedoid clustering
3) cluster Spectral - use KMeans clustering of spectral embeddings

Also, you can save your graphs, load them, export embeddings images. 
Check "File" menu item next to "Help". 


Enjoy!
